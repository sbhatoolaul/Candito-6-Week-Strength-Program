# Candito-6-Week-Strength-Program

## Description
An iOS application for Jonnie Canditoâ€™s famous and free 6 week powerlifting program.

I made this app as a side project, because I was getting tired of reading the program from an Excel spreadsheet everytime I was in the gym. There is an iOS app already out there containing Candito's program, but it also contains many other powerlifting programs that I don't follow, and it requires you to sign up.

I do not plan to upload this app to the App Store, or make this repo public, because all rights to the program belong to Jonnie Candito.
